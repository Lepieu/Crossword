# Crossword

This project was created for the HarvardX CS50 AI course and written in Python. It uses the input files from the data directory to generate a valid crossword.

## Usage

Modify /data/structure0.txt
- This contains the structure of the crossword puzzle
- Use a combination of # and _ characters to create a square grid for the structure (i.e. #___# means the middle 3 out of 5 spaces on the line are to be filled by letters)

Modify /data/words0.txt: 
- This contains the list of words that can be used in the crossword
- Each word should be separated by a line
